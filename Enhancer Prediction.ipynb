    "# Enhancer Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is an attempt at predicting enhancer regions based on open chromatin/1D omic data. It is simlar to the [Anshul Kundaje lab's](https://simons.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/docs/4575/2016-kundaje-simonsinstitute-deeplearning.pdf) attempts at predicting chromatin state/other chromatin marks based on ATAC-seq, Dnase-seq, and MNase-seq data. Data used in this repository comes from Roadmap's processed data for [Dnase/Histone ChIP](http://egg2.wustl.edu/roadmap/web_portal/processed_data.html) and for [ChromHMM genomic annotations](http://egg2.wustl.edu/roadmap/web_portal/chr_state_learning.html#exp_18state).  \n",

    "To start, we need to download the Dnase-seq ([peaks](http://egg2.wustl.edu/roadmap/data/byFileType/peaks/consolidated/narrowPeak/) + [tagAlign](http://egg2.wustl.edu/roadmap/data/byFileType/alignments/consolidated) files), and [ChromHMM annotations](http://egg2.wustl.edu/roadmap/web_portal/chr_state_learning.html#exp_18state) from Roadmap. I will use the expanded 18 state annotation because it has H3K27ac and contains more states. All of the starting data except the tagAlign file are available in the data folder. \n",
